# PHP REST API
This project was inspired by Brad Traversy from Traversy Media. He made a project using ReactJS and used the API of his favorite show, Breaking Bad (API).
So I wanted to make a similar project, except, my favorite show didn't have it's own API so I made a RESTful API in PHP of the show Peaky Blinders.

There are 2 databases in the project which can be imported with PHPMyAdmin.
One contains most of the information of the characters while the other exists as an extension if in the future I decide to add more details.
